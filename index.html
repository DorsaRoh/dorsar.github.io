    <h2>What is Decolonization?</h2>
  <p>Decolonization is the cultural, economic, and psychological liberty of Indigenous peoples with the goal of achieving Indigenous sovereignty and resurgence.
Therefore, decolonization is an important factor in the journey towards Truth and Reconciliation, and the process of Indienous healing.
Indigenous sovereignty is the right and ability of Indigenous people to practice self-determination over their land, cultures, and political and economic systems.
Practiced prior to the arrival of colonists, colonialist influence, and the consequences of colonization over Indigenous society.
Colonialism is a historical and ongoing global endeavor where settlers continue to occupy land, dictate social, political, and economic systems, and exploit Indigenous people and their resources.
Colonialism was commonly practiced prior to the 1900s when nations around the world sought to acquire the resources, status, money, and exploit found from global travels, unknown lands, and frequent voyage.</p>

        <h2>Decolonial Values and Indigenous Peoples</h2>
        <p>Decolonization can be defined as taking away the “colonial”, as well as the influences, changes, and alterations caused by colonization and the colonialists
Decolonization can also be referred to as the antonym of colonization, essentially the consequence of colonization after the colonized party regains power, control, resources, and land. However, decolonization was not widely practiced prior to the 1900s due to the lack of colonized parties regaining power.</p>
        <p>In the context of Canada, decolonization is often and commonly referred to in terms of the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, and how it can be not only addressed, but strengthened and protected as well.</p>
        <p>Decolonization in Canada is affiliated with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as it relates to Indigenous resurgence. Therefore, it is vitally important to be educated on such a matter, and ensure others are educated as well.</p>
        <p>Indigenous resurgence is a frequent theme affiliated with decolonization in Canada, as it is defined as Indigenous people reclaiming and restoring their culture, land, language, relationships, health, etc., both independent of and with the support of non-Indigenous people
Decolonization is additionally associated with other relationships between groups of people within Canada and in other countries and contexts around the world.</p>
