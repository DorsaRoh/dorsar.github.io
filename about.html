    <h2>The Indigenous Uprising</h2>
  <p>Revolving around topics of Indigenization, and the affiliation, role, and component Indigenization plays towards Indigenous decolonization around the world.
If decolonization is the removal or undoing of colonial elements, then Indigenization could be seen as the addition or redoing of Indigenous elements. Commonly referred to as a synonym of Indigenous resurgence
Indigenization moves beyond tokenistic gestures of recognition or inclusion to meaningfully change practices and structures. Indigenization moves beyond tokenistic gestures of recognition or inclusion to meaningfully change practices and structures.
Dominance, power and influence are returned to Indigenous communities, and Indigenous means of processing knowledge and doing are acknowledged and practiced as equal to Western historical ways of processing, passing down, and analyzing knowledge.
In rebalancing the distribution of power between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Canada, we are able to acknowledge the years of colonization that affected Indigenous communities, and thus prevented them from acknowledging, practicing, and embracing their culture, customs, traditions, and practices.
Therefore, the education of such matters is crucial in rehabilitating and reconstructing Canada.</p>

        <h2>Values and Tradition</h2>
        <p>For some, decolonization is also linked to broader principles of inclusion and equity. Not only is it vital to restoring justice to Indigenous communities affected by colonization, but it is equally a means of restoring equality in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Canada. Sources such as Indigenous story-telling are powerful. This means of source can help us draw conclusions, connections, and reflections to our guiding question, as it provides a clear description of what decolonization is not only on a global scale, but what it defines as in cultural, social, psychological, historical, economic, and political context as well. In addition, it enables us to frame historical and contemporary illustrations of how decolonization manifested through exploitation, and what the intentions were of the individuals who performed this colonization (in other words, the group commonly referred to as settlers). In applying this information to our final product, we can use the significance of colonization, and the perspectives of this endeavor from the two parties involved in this case-- the colonizers and the colonized-- to reach a consensus on what we would like our final product to achieve, be built towards, and what it can potentially address in doing so. Not only is it incredibly important to assure we are educated on such vital matters ourselves, but we have a simultaneous collective duty as Canadians to assure others are educated as well.
